# Construct Work in Progress 🛠️

Welcome to my corner of the internet, where I document my adventures in cloud computing and cybersecurity. This repository serves as my virtual journal, chronicling my journey from 2020 to the present day.

## About Me
I'm Vasanthabalaji, tech enthusiast with a passion for all things cloud-related. You can find me as [mr.cloudexplorer](https://github.com/Vasanthabalaji01) on GitHub. When I'm not coding or learning about security, I'm probably enjoying music or immersed in illustration arts.
